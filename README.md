# Amazon-Restock-Discord-Webhook
A Python Script to quickly setup a discord web hook to monitor an amazon store page.

# What you need to change to get this working
# On line 34 set the text to your discord Web hook url
# On line 59 set the link to the amazon store page you are monitoring [For convenience]
# On line 115 set the link to the amazon store page [MANDATORY]
# Need to monitor more StorePages? Simple just duplicate main.py and config.txt and put them in a separate folder and launch
# That or if you want it in 1 folder you will have to refactor all references to config.txt to like config2.txt etc in your duplicated file.
# You can then set the same web hook URL But different store page
# DO NOT DISTRIBUTE THIS CODE AS YOUR OWN WITHOUT MY PERMISSION

# DEPENDENCIES -

# Newish version of pip
# NOTE YOU NEED TO HAVE THESE LIBRARIES INSTALLED VIA CMD OR IDE CMD
